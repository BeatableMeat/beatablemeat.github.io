# BEATABLE MEAT PORTAL
Since we don't want to spend money in the Beatable Meat project, and the main website's link is very long, we decided to make this website hosted on Github.

# POSTING IN THE ISSUES PAGE
Please note that the issues page is not justs for literal *issues*, but you can request something to be added to one of the sites. One of the moderators of the repository will add a label to your post to identify what it is.

## Site codes
If you do not include a site code at the start of the title of your post to show what website you're posting the issue for, your post will be closed and given the label `invalid` and will you have to edit the post. Once it is corrected, a moderator will re-open the post.

### The site codes are the following:
- `[BM]` — Beatable Meat
- `[Portal]` — Beatable Meat Portal (except for the Beatable Games HTML subpage)
- `[BG]` — Beatable Games
- `[BGHTM]` — Beatable Games HTML
- `[GitHub]` — The Beatable Meat Portal GitHub repository
- `[BM2020]` — The Bruh-o-Meter 2020 website
- `[Flash]` — glitchgod's Flash Repo
