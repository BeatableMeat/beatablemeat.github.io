A simple clone of the snake game, developed as my first attempt at using `canvas` and Javascript.

It was originally intended for the [0hgame jam](http://0hgame.eu), but couldn't make it on time. 

You can try it [live](http://diz.es/snake).

Thankful mention to [Bill Mill's tutorial](http://billmill.org/static/canvastutorial/), my starting point.
